Coding guidelines
-Minmize usage of locks.  Use thread based synchronization provided by actor model
-Not much code in constructor. Just assign memeber variables.  Do all initialization code in
 init() method
-User CLog macro for logging.  This wrapper macro on glog macro logs context as well.  Useful in in unit tests that run multiple services in the same addressspace.
