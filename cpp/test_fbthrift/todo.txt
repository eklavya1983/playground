Design
-Create a proxy replica actor that is wrapper around ThirftClient
-Create ProxyTClientActor
--
-ThirftClient is provided by svc map.  We will cache 
-Create a server
-Being able to set dynamic behavior


Coordinator
-Add volume
*Based on replication factor determine the nodes on which to deploy
*Store the replica node info in config
*Send spawn replica group message to each node in the group


Service
-Run rpc server
-Init ActorSystem
-SvcHandleMgr

ActorSystem
-Spawn replica group actor

Replica group actor
-Bootstrap behvior
-Primary functional behavior
-Follower functional bevhavior
-Group membership reconcilation behavior
-Syncing behavior
-Manage actor proxies

proxy actor
*We can do this later
*enqueues messages onto SvcHandle

rpc server

Work Items
-Two pieces where was it sent..wchih behavior is handling it
-Run config service
-Make sure we aren't making unnecessary copies as messages are routed
-Create a test with config service
-Registration with config service
-Add volume api against cofig service
-config service sends add volume message to each registerd repllica with primary, secondary, etc.assignments.
-Add basic support for behaviors
-On the replica side go through init sequence where replica is decided
-go into ready state
-make serialization registation static similar gtest initialization
