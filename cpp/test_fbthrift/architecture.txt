Principles
-decouple modules
-swappable modules.  Implement an interface
-no globals
-try to minimize dependency on config service.  If config service is down, only config paths should be impacted.

-On volume create, decide on which replicas will hold the volume
-Volume config channel
--Single publisher, multiple-subscriber.  One way flow from publisher to subscribers.
--sequence id for config channel.  Can be same as # of entries pushed into the channel.
--getCurrentVolumeConfig returns current volume config at current sequence id

Ideas
-Using kafka as a temp store for logging operations for a particular group when service is down
