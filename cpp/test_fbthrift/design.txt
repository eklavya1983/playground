Adding nodes
-We will have addnode script
-This command will be run from the node itself
-It will do hardward discovery and report to config service
-It will also configure services to run
-After node is added to via config service, infromation returned from config service is stamped on the node

Service bootup
-Service will have following args
--nic_if, root, port
-At root we expect json file with node information validated by config service.  This will contain node name for now
